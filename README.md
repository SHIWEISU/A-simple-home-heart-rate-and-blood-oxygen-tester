# A-simple-home-heart-rate-and-blood-oxygen-tester
This project is a lightweight, open-source heart rate and blood oxygen (SpO₂) monitoring system designed for home use!
. Built around the MAX30102 pulse oximeter and heart-rate sensor. It wellness tracking, or educational purposes. 
Here is a simple demo based on the proven module：

After putting your finger on it for 3~5 seconds, the module will calculate your heart rate, blood oxygen and current PPG waveform and display it accurately on the OLED screen.

This picture shows that the heart rate and oxygen values are almost identical to the standard instrument (the instrument data is for reference only and should not be used as a standard of care).

After attempting the module build, the following reference circuit diagrams are provided for more integrated products
